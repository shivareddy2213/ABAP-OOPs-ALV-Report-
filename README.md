# ABAP-OOPs-ALV-Report-
This contain ALV report using OOPs concepts in ABAP. 
In this I created two custom tables one is employee table and the other one is employee salary table.
In this I used 'slis_t_fieldcat_alv' structure for fieldcatalog and created fieldcatalog manually.
And sorted the list according to department.
I used 'REUSE_ALV_GRID_DISPLAY' Function to display the list.
